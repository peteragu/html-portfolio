        Fans call for Casemiro to be <strong>'SOLD'</strong> after Olise ended the Brazilians career
    </h2>

    <p>
        Manchester United fans have called on Casemiro to be sold for his role in Crystal palace opening goal. <br>

        United fans have been left fuming on social media, with some calling on Casemiro to be siold after his disappointing season continued.
